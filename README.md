# Introduction To RTL to GDSII Flow
  RTL to GDSII Flow refers to the all the steps involved in converting a logical Register Transfer Level(RTL) Design to a fabrication ready GDSII format. GDSII is a database file format which is an industry standard for data exchange of IC layout artwork.
  The RTL to GSDII flow consists of following steps:
  - RTL Synthesis
  - Static Timing Analysis(STA)
  - Design for Testability(DFT)
  - Floorplanning
  - Placement
  - Clock Tree Synthesis(CTS)
  - Routing
  - GDSII Streaming
 
 All the steps are further discussed in details in the repository.
  
# About Google SkyWater PDK
  Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry in collaboration have released a completely open-source Process Design Kit(PDK) in May, 2020. The current release target to a SKY130 (i.e. 130 nm) process node is available as [SkyWater Open Source PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk). The PDK provides Physical VLSI Designer with a wide range of flexibility in design choices. All the designs and simulations listed in this repository are carried out using the same SkyWater Open Source PDK.

# Setting Up Environment
  The above list of tools shows that, many different tools are required for various tasks in Physical VLSI Design. Each tool in itself have number of system requirements and require various supporting tools to be installed. Installing each tool one-by-one seems in-efficient. This is made easy by some custom scripts that setup the required tools and environment for them in just a few easy steps. To install all the required tools, one can refer to the below mentioned repositories:
  - [VSDFlow](https://github.com/kunalg123/vsdflow) - Installs Yosys, Magic, OpenTimer, OpenSTA and some other supporting tools
  - [OpenLANE Build Scripts](https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script) - Install all required OpenROAD and some supporting tools
  
# Day 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
 ## Basic IC Design Terminologies
  During the Physical Designing, one will come across multiple terminologies that are frequently used. Some of them are mentioned below:
  - Package: It is a case that surrounds the circuit material to protect it from physical damage or corrosion and allow mounting of the electrical contacts connecting it to the printed circuit board (PCB). The below snippet shows an IC with 48 pins and Quad Flat No-Leads(QFN) package.
  - Die: A die is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated.
  - Core: It is the actual area of the IC where the logic resides.
  - Pads: These are the interfaces between the internal signals of a chip and the external pins




 ## Open-Source EDA Tools
 ### OpenLANE Initialization
   For invoking OpenLANE in Linux Ubuntu, we should first run the docker container everytime we use OpenLANE. This is done by using the following script:
    
    docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) openlane:rc6
    
    
   However for the workshop, I used the cloud platform and didnot run openlane in containerized docker on my linux WSL. If interested in this flow, you can refer here. 
    
   
   A custom shell script or commands can be generated to make the task simpler.
   
   - To invoke OpenLANE run the `./flow.tcl` script.
   - OpenLANE supports two modes of operation: interactive and autonomous.
   - To use interactive mode use `-interactive` flag with `./flow.tcl`  
     - I used the interactive mode to investigate the flow and edit configuration files to understand the influence on the configurations.

   ### Design Preparation
   The first step after invoking OpenLANE is to import the openlane package of required version. This is done using following command. Here 0.9 is the required version of OpenLANE. This imports all the packages required to run in the flow , so this needs to be done everytime when running the flow.
   
    ```package require openlane 0.9 ```
    
Designs running through openlane are extracted from the /designs directory. We can use existing design in this folder or create one of our own in this folder. I'm going to use the picorv32a design.  Have the ril in this directory or configure the config.tcl as you can see the sourcefile selected in this file. 
    
    Note that the precedence for configuration file values :
    - Default value in openlane
    - config.tcl in design
    - sky130A_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl 

<img src="Screenshot/L2_directory_structure.png">
    
Key files generated from preparation phase: 
      - merged.lef file has the lef information created under runs directory.
      - reults (results)
      - reports (timing analysis stc file )
      - log (log for each and every step)
      - config.tcl (This shows what all default parameters are taken by the run. So this will reflect any changes made on the fly on the original configuration file)
      - cmd.log (logs all commands)

### Design Synthesis and Results
The first step in OpenLANE flow is RTL Synthesis of the design selected from the designs directory. This is done using the following command.
   
    ```run_synthesis```

 Results are populated in the runs folder. 
 From the synthesis you can observe the Area of the synthesized macro as well as other statistics generated from Yosys such as the flop ratios.

 Flop ratio observed: 
 The statistics are available in corresponding directories such as synthesis

 The mapping is available in mapping file/synthesized netlist as picorv32a.synthesis.v
